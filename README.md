Today,we had a session on operating systems and version control, we delved into the fascinating world of Linux derivatives and Git. It was an enlightening session that explored the foundations of operating systems and the importance of version control in software development.

We began by discussing Linux derivatives, which are operating systems based on the Linux kernel. We examined popular distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS, understanding their unique features, package managers, and user interfaces. Through interactive discussions and demonstrations, we explored the versatility, stability, and vast software ecosystem that Linux derivatives offer. Participants had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with different distributions, installing them on virtual machines and exploring their functionalities.

Moving on to version control, we dived into the essential tool known as Git. We explored the concept of version control and its significance in managing changes to source code and collaborating with a team. Through practical examples and exercises, I learned the fundamental Git commands, including initialization, staging, committing and branching. We also explored remote repositories and the process of pushing and pulling changes using Git.

Throughout the session, we actively engaged in discussions, asking questions, and shared our experiences with Linux derivatives and Git. By the end of the session, we had a solid understanding of Linux derivatives and were equipped with the foundational knowledge of Git version control.

This session on operating systems and version control served as a stepping stone in building a strong technical foundation. I left with newfound knowledge and skills that will undoubtedly benefit them in their future endeavors as software developers or system administrators.
